- This is my portfolio, the beginners version and that isn't Schrodinger's cat. I'm gonna use the Card Deck Api to get a random card. My card will show up on the initial page and you'll be able to input a number and take the chance that, that'll be the card you chose on submit. I have an about me link and you'll read a little bit about me like some things I love, if you haven't noticed already. I hope you'll enjoy.
